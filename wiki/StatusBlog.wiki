Yeah, it's been a while since my last update, but I got quite a lot things to do here at home and at work (and sometimes work at home :/ ) so the raidplaner had to wait. Additionally I switched guilds in WoW, and my new Guild is using EQDKP now (which is still a pain in the ass to use), so I'm currently "starving" on frequent feedback : /.
However - I guess my work will keep me busy for an additional 1 or 2 weekends, so don't expect too many updates in the next two weeks. The good news about that: While waiting the folks a t jquery released a beta of their "mobile" jquery framework, which *might* just fix some issues I have with drag and drop so I now tend to wait a little bit more before going deeper into the touch device problems. This means I will most likely start to implement the new features like user statistics, etc. before returning to the touch device problems.

I started experimenting with some jQuery plugins that enable touch events.
Sadly I did not yet find something that provides a convenient drag&grop solution similar to jQuery UI's draggable/droppable functionality. So that problem will be delayed a bit further. At the up side, I can now access a "double tap" event so that I can re-enable shortcut functions for touch devices, too.

As for the selection boxes, I decided to switch back to the "classic" style for mobile devices (removing the jQuery UI skin). This way I can let the device decide what's best without having to create any compromises for desktop PCs. The only thing left here is how to create an "editable selectionbox" which is not available with standard forms, but I guess a simple popup will do the trick here.

My vacation, and a short crunch phase at work is over, so I guess development will start again soon.
During my vacation I had a chance to test the raidplaner on an iPad, but I was not really satisfied with the results.

The controls are much too small for touch devices and the layout is not ... well ... fitting the screen as it should. So I will add some more work to shrink the vertical size of the raidplaner to 720px (from now 768px), resize some buttons and play around with the selection boxes a bit more.

For the latter I'm not quite sure about how to handle those exactly. I could create a new skin which is more touch friendly, but this would also restrict the mouse users to a more "clunky" version, reducing the usability for the PC platform.
Removing the skin only for touch devices would help on iPhones (as they display an extra widget), but I've not yet tested that solution with android devices and there might be additional layout problems as I would always have to support two code pathes.

So before I start with the implementation of user statistics I will first make some changes to make the raidplaner more touch-friendly which will delay everything by another week or so.
