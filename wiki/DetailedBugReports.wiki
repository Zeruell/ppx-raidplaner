Some errors require more information than just a description about what happend.
In this case I'm always glad about some extra data.

If a page does not display or changes are not submitted.
The steps are for Google Chrome, but Safari dev tools or Firefox/Firebug can be used, too (slightly different steps though).

 * In Chrome, open the dev tools _(menu -> tools -> developer tools, or ctrl+shift+i (win) / cmd+alt+i (mac))_
 * Switch to *"Network"*, Show only *"XHR"* at the bottom
 * Open the raidplaner, login, reproduce the problem
 * Check for an entry called *"messagehub.php"* choose the last entry in the list with that name
 * From *"headers"* I need the content of *"Form data"*
 * From *"response"* I need a copy of everything included (select all, copy, paste)

If you have access to the php.ini on your server it would be great to enable all errors before doing this:

 * error_reporting = E_ALL
 * display_errors = On
 * html_errors = Off

Note that these settings should be reverted to their original values once you're done.
