== Version 0.9.8 (May 2013) ==

Version 0.9.8 introduces removed and renamed many files. Almost every file was touched due to cleanup.
So if you did any modifications to the codebase, grab yourself a good merge tool.<br>
For all other users it is recommended to do a clean install, i.e. save your config files -> remove all files of your previous version -> copy the new version -> copy your old config files and run the update script.
