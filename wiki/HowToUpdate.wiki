= How do I update the Raidplaner? =

Just follow the process below:

# *Backup your current files and database!*
# Copy the contents of the new package to your FTP. Make sure that your "lib/config" folder is not overwritten
# Open http://<your url>/setup, click on "update" and follow the instructions

If you've used an intermediate version of Raidplaner, there might be some error messages during the update process. As the update script tries to take partially updated installations into account you can ignore these in almost all cases.
However - if something went wrong it will help me to know which update steps failed, so it is advisable to keep the messages somewhere (e.g. make a screenshot).
