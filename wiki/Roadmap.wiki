Short todo list for upcoming versions.
Items and timing may change.

= Current status for 0.9.5 =
Current repository version is 0.9.2

Done:
 * Better drag and drop for raids
 * Fixed sticky login (damn, I hate these session quirks)
 * EQDKP binding added
 * vBulletin 3.x binding added
 * some potential SQL injection vectors removed
 
Next on the list:
 * Finding and handling the renaming of external users, as well as password change for local users
 * Android devices cannot use double click, so I need to think of something else here
 * The setup script needs support for the two new bindings
