= Beyond 1.0 =

The following features can be described as "yeah, I would totally like to see those, but they do not make sense before 1.0".<br>
If they make it into a (earlier) version depends on how much sense they make / how much they will break the code or concept.

 * Dark theme
 * Better integration into portal / content management systems
